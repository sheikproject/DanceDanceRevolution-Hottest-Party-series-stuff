For the moment this doesn't cover modding them, since I still didn't tried to create new events.

Let's start with the header StoryFile (I will use the ev02 as a example):
<img width="570" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/757b5b2a-bb5f-4f3f-b36c-c4bef633974e" />

The value in 0x10 to 0x13 is always the same and seems to do nothing, I tried to null those bytes but the game loaded the event normally, but the value in 0x17 seems to do something with the sprites, here is what happen when I changed the byte to 0A:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_22-47-13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82798705-4383-456f-a863-fde4af860ce1" />
The background dissapeared but if I change it to 09 Stella's portrait dissapears aswell.

Now to the next section name_L:

<img width="569" height="632" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/770da9a6-0c83-4647-8c64-205166f3a137" />

Here you can change the name of the character at the Left, you can also change the font size and the coordinates. 
DO NOT change the 0A value in 0x33 it will CRASH the game (I still dont know why).

Let's start with 0x3B (the one with the 01 value), If you change this value like for example 02, the name will move at the RIGHT:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_22-56-20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b4a2086-4105-4dc9-b947-4db498f0fa4f" />

In 0x48 (3E8) it doesn't seems to do anything but if I just change that value to 000 this happens:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_23-04-09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a48a7a05-f30c-4551-bd0c-f600024b978f" />

But it goes back to normal after Bloom speaks so idk what it really does.

6B (0x4F) also controls the name coordinates, but this time to the LEFT (I changed it to 0B):

<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_23-10-47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40ef8497-670d-4d68-8c75-f0b4aea6da2c" />

And another value that controls the coordinates this time UP and DOWN, 121 in 0x52 I just changed to 021 so the name goes UP in the sky:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_23-12-08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7451203e-50f3-428e-95cd-d578be9f7e7c" />

01 in 0x57 makes the name appears instanly, if you change it to 0 it will appear the same way how the dialogue does.

And 18 (0x5B) is the name font size, if you change it to any value like 28 this happens:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_23-17-10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c7a058a-b0f9-4576-86dc-21c99edaa3ad" />

Knowing these, the values below work the same way with the different names, so let's skip them:
<img width="574" height="260" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1b62ef2-b783-499b-b285-55daf59ee857" />

Starting in 0x188 seems to control the name again but if changed to 07D000C8 the name won't dissapear, so something related to the character you selected first (I think).

name_R works the same way as everything I explained but to the character at the RIGHT so let's skip it to nameFrame_L:


<img width="577" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e486d471-5269-48e1-b5ef-efeafdfe9209" />

This controls the name frame aka the name box window, again DO NOT touch the value in 0x383 it will again CRASH the game and the same goes to 01 (0x387).

01 (0x38B) controls the box LEFT/RIGHT coordinates, so if you change it to 00 it will go to the LEFT:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_23-40-37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b565f333-1d13-4617-9342-50504c21be2a" />

Now we gonna make another jump to 0x3C3, this controls if the box should stay or dissapear, so if I changed it from 02 to 01 it won't dissapear:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_23-44-10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8232a11-2d82-4aee-8276-f755140d3a2f" />

07D0 (0x3C8) kinda works the same as before but you can make it dissapear since the start of the event, or at least it happened to me if I change 07 to 00:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_23-47-27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96069a7b-0a05-439b-95e0-1d948cb00f15" />

84 (0x3F3) also controls the box coordinates, changed 84 to 04:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_23-48-28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9900683-34fb-4bce-a10d-81dd24287a1c" />

0130 (0x3F6) again controls the coordinates but UP or DOWN, changed 01 to 00:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-26_23-50-06" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f96a13a2-7a25-4aad-9467-e1f34727d0b7" />

And another value that will CRASH the game, 01 (0x417) so DON'T touch it.

nameFrame_R works the same so let's skip it again.

Now to the dialogue text, we will start with the header part msg:
<img width="575" height="103" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8238aff7-cac6-4955-b14f-f7da63d26494" />

0A (0x563) will also CRASH the game, 01 (0x56B) controls the text coordinates to the LEFT, changed its value to 04:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-27_00-00-47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3f15356-dabb-42cc-8004-8e9c072bc1d5" />

9B in 0x579, I can't explain what it does ðŸ˜­, if I add 01 in 0x578 the text won't appear after some second have passed, if I decreased that value to for example 0B it will appear before the portraits:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-27_00-05-36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/220d914e-3650-4f0b-b94f-db64932b24b6" />

4B (0x57F) controls the text location, changed 4B to FB:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-27_00-07-04" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef959daa-5780-458e-9cb4-afeab2d94316" />

And now some values from way before appear again, like 014F (0x583) which controls the text UP and DOWN coordinates and 18 (0x58B) which is the font size.

<img width="568" height="71" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6983cc2b-da6c-4d08-8c81-5ea65c0d1903" />

Now you can see the actual text depending of your language file, 05 (0x5B3) seems to control if the text will we skipped or not, I changed it to 04 and 01 and the first text dialogue got skipped.

And below, the values are reapeated but for the next text dialogue.

Now we will see msgFrame which controls the text box:
<img width="578" height="322" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23272116-9f3f-4b58-adc9-947e152d392f" />

And again 04 (0x7F3) and 01 (0x7F7) will CRASH the game if changed. 01 (0x7FB) controls the LEFT and RIGHT coordinates (Only works with 00, 01 and 02):
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-27_00-36-38" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b22e6d88-a7ae-40c8-85bb-14e8b0aaf3d4" />

03 (0x803) has some effects like making the text box dissapear or making the characters and the text box dissapear and resets the event.

1E (0x809) can make the text box dissapear if you add bigger values (maybe it controls the time that takes to load the box?)

04 (0x833) can make the box go UP or DOWN:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-27_00-43-44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad940886-52b1-461c-b659-c7db6266b0f8" />

CE (0x843) controls the animation (I think?).

And the next values are repeated again for this section.

Now let's go to FrameL which controls the Left frame graphic:
<img width="568" height="322" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/705b3d28-0685-402d-9538-90a9212026cd" />

Now with 04 (0x913) it will also crash the game but if you change it to 00 this will happen:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-27_00-48-59" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be1c6799-0dfe-4afd-9472-51f65a5108c2" />

In 01 (0x917) if you change it to 02 this happens:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-27_00-50-10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c30c1961-a29a-46d0-865a-a37b7eeaad3c" />

0D (0x923) controls the loading of the graphic, so if you increased this value it will appear much later, the same happens to 1E (0x929).

04 (0x953) controls the location of the graphic, changed to F4:
<img width="1668" height="960" alt="RW6PA4_2025-08-27_00-54-45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47293cf3-ff90-42bc-98c3-cd14f3ccbd79" />

Below I couldn't find anything more that changed and FrameR works the same so let's go to the next section:
<img width="570" height="701" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e663247a-4df4-40b8-ae2b-de60c5732583" />

To be added.....................................
